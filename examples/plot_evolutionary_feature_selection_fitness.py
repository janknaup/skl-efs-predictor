=================================================================
Evolutionary Feature Selection Transformer - Fitness of Specimens
=================================================================

An example plot of :class:`evolutionary_feature_selection.EvolutionaryFeatureSelection` fitness trace.

The data set has 20 features, all of which are random in the range [0..1]. The response depends only on the first 5
variables by the formula:

    0.5 + (8.0 * X[:, 0]) + (6.0 * X[:, 1]) + (4.0 * X[:, 2]) + (2.0 * X[:,  3]) + X[:, 4]

Each line in the plot shows the fitness of the specimen occupying one place in the population, ranked by the fitness
value.

The algorithm is set up to contain 20 specimens, the top 50% of which (10) are allowed to breed. Each specimen is
set to contain 5 features.
